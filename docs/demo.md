<span class="text-italic text-primary" id="article-info">
Ever wondered what Markdown looked like parsed through Symfony? Me too.
</span>
<p class="text-light">
This is some more text within the markdown.

Test text. This is more text added to the file.

What does it look like when text is added to the file in another window?
